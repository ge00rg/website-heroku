Mathias received his BSc in Bioinformatics from the Free University in Berlin and his MSc in Computational Neuroscience from the Technical University Berlin. During his studies, he was a visiting researcher with the Adaptive Behaviour and Coginition group at Plymouth University, UK, and the Adaptive Systems lab at Humboldt Universität zu Berlin which sparked his interest in representation learning and embodied cognition. He joined the Modelling of Cognitive Processes group for his PhD in February 2017 and is now working to understand the interplay between action and perception in reinforcement learning agents.
