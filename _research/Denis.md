In this project we try to understand how episodic to semantic memory
transformations can arise in a previously proposed circuit mechanism for systems memory
consolidation. We use computational neuroscience models combined with methods
from machine learning and mathematical analysis to investigate how
architectural and representational constraints can give rise to the
transformation of memories and how these transformations might on the one hand
explain semantisation of memory content and on the other hand control factors
such as hippocampus dependency of memories and consolidation speed. We plan to
test the predictions of our theory on the odor memory system in the Drosophila
brian.
