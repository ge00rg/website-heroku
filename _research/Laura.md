Presynaptic  GABA(B)  receptors  have  been  shown  to  modulate  the  activity  of  neural  circuits  by  inhibiting  calcium  channels  which  causes  a  reduction  in  neurotransmitter  release.  Activation  of  presynaptic  GABA(B)  receptors  at  excitatory  synapses  occurs  as  a  result  of  GABA  spillover  from  nearby  inhibitory  synapses.  Therefore  presynaptic  inhibition  is  a  compensatory  process  that  multiplicatively  alters  effective  synaptic  strength.  We  investigate  the  functional  implications  of  such  a  mechanism  using  simulations  of  biologically  inspiredspiking  networks  and  mathematical  analyses  of  simplified  phenomenological  models.
