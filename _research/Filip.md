The  existence  of  specialized  mechanisms  for  burst  generation  in  pyramidal  cells  (PCs)  suggests  that  bursts  are  likely  to  be  an  important  temporal  feature  of  neural  signals.  In L5  PCs  bursts  occur  at  a  low,  but  consistent  rate,  and  are  thought  to  arise  from  active  dendritic  processes.  Given  that  burst  activity  relies  on  dendritic  threshold  mechanisms,  it  appears  likely  that  low  burst  activity  require  homeostatic  control,  but  the  underlying  mechanisms  are  not  resolved.  In  this  research  project  we  model  a  biologically  inspired  circuit  diagram  of  a  self-organized  microcircuit  with  different  inhibitory  cell  types  and  plasticity  rules  to  control  the  burst  and  population  rate  of  PCs.  Our  work  shows  that  inhibitory  plasticity  rules  may  serve  as  building  blocks  to  self-organise  complex  network  architectures  and  allows  us  to  investigate  coding  properties  of  bursting  units  without  the  need  for  tuning  of  input  or  noise  levels.
